<h2>
EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p>
I have been freelancing graphic design services for more than 25 years for happy clients in varied industries. I have a thorough knowledge and experience with print design of all types from corporate identity to publication advertising. I work with clients from developing a logo and the needed corporate identity materials through building a marketing plan and implementing it successfully thought elegant design. I can make your company stand out from your logo to your advertising, whether print or electronic.

I also work with publishers to see that their periodicals hit the streets on time with visual impact. Helping several clients segue to digital publishing, quality design continues to play a vital role in keeping a publication interesting and memorable. Plus meeting the deadline with 100 well done pages is no small trick but we do it regularly.

<h2>
EDUCATION</h2>
<p>
After successfully completing two years at Rocky Mountain School of Art and graduating with a degree in commercial art and a minor in photography, I went on to the Community College of Auraria and studied graphic arts and printing. From there I enrolled in Metropolitan State University to study marketing and economics. Since leaving university, I've studied in many workshops and online courses to further my design skills. I'm currently enrolled at General Assembly to study front end web development with the hope to assist my clients with their website design needs.
