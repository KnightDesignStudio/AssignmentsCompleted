I am a graphic designer with 40 years experience in assisting business with finding customers through marketing with attention-getting design. I concentrate on helping smaller business owners keep the doors open by reaching their targeted buyer through a well-thought through marketing plan. Pair that with excellent design and copy that tells your story and your bottom line will thrive. Ask my clients how I've helped them.

<p>
I also specialize in publishing with an extensive background in publication design for books, magazines and newspapers. Having been art director of more than 15 publications, I have the experience to succesfully complete large, multi-page publications with design flair and prodctuion excellence. I've won numerous publication design awards through the years, you should come by and take a look some time. If you're thinking about starting a magazine or online ezine, I can help you make the right choices for success.

My hobby turned avocation is photography, a nice fit with my design business. For tight budgets, I've often supplied the photography necessary to compliment a client's marketing message with an enthusiastic reception on their part. I can make you and your company look your best and understand what images your customer would like to see from you. On my off hours, I'm busy with hiking and nature photography. Follow my Facebook page and Instagram feed if you want to see where I've been lately.

<p>
Currently I'm studying front end web development at General Assembly to put coding skills with my web design experience. In learning how to code, I hope to assist clients with even more of their marketing needs and interface with programmers in their language. I will be putting these new skills to work directly with a new company website.
